# Basic 2D Game Engine

This project is a basic 2D game engine with a basic platformer game. The main goals of the game engine are to:
- Create something easy to use and reuse in different cases (different types of 2D games);
- Provide a basic Game Engine Application with a gameloop and image rendering methods;
- Provide Vector and basic physics math;
- Provide some interface and base classes to write custom game objects to build the game.
